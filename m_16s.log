Heuristic search settings:
  Optimality criterion = parsimony
    Character-status summary:
      Of 1638 total characters:
        All characters are of type 'unord'
        All characters have equal weight
        926 characters are constant
        240 variable characters are parsimony-uninformative
        Number of parsimony-informative characters = 472
    Multistate taxa interpreted as uncertainty
  Starting tree(s) obtained via stepwise addition
  Addition sequence: simple (reference taxon = MN)
  Number of trees held at each step during stepwise addition = 1
  Branch-swapping algorithm: tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR)
  Steepest descent option not in effect
  Initial 'MaxTrees' setting = 100
  Branches collapsed (creating polytomies) if maximum branch length is zero
  'MulTrees' option in effect
  Topological constraints not enforced
  Trees are unrooted

Heuristic search completed
   Total number of rearrangements tried = 1199
   Score of best tree(s) found = 1750
   Number of trees retained = 2
   Time used = <1 sec (CPU time = 0.00 sec)
